# Skeleton code for Assignment 2, 3, and Project for Stat Method Course

Tips:
+ Test your posterior sampling code. See this [reference](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/Cook_Software_Validation.pdf).
+ Use debugger. For example, you can `import pdb` and set break point using command `pdb.set_trace()`.
+ Fix random seed before running your sampling code to be able to reproduce any bugs: i.e., `np.random.seed(some_seed)`
